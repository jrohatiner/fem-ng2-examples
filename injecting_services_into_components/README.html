<h3>Injecting a Service into a Component</h3>

<p>We inject a service into a component simply by importing the service, creating a reference to it in the constructor of our component, and giving it the type of our service.</p>

<p>
<pre>
  import { MyService } from &#39;./services/my.service.ts&#39;;
  export class MyComponent {
    constructor(service: MyService) {
      this.stuff = service.performAction();
    }
  }
</pre>
</p>
