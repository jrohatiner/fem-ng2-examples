<h3>Http Error Handling</h3>

<ol><li>Import the <code>Observable</code> function from <code>RxJS</code></li><li>Add a <code>.catch</code> operator to the end of the observable sequence, passing it a function that takes an error</li></ol>

<blockquote><p><strong>Note:</strong> we just logged the error to the console for now, in reality you would probably want to push it to a remote server or something of that sort</p></blockquote>
