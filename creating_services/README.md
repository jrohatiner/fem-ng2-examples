### Creating a Service
1. A service is just a class
2. The service's API is defined by it's class methods
3. Import the service into the component and add it to the `providers` array of the target component
4. To access it in the component class, provide a variable in the constructor whose type is the service
5. We can use a TypeScript `interface` to describe the data in our service; just import the interface wherever the custom type is needed and use it like any other primitive type
6. To access the service outside of the constructor, simply reference it as `this.service`

### Hierarchical Injectors
For simplicity's sake, we will assume that every component gets its own injector. When a component requests a dependency, Angular searches through the parent injectors until it finds the dependency it needs. However, we can provide different instances of a service to different components. This is handy if, for instance, you wanted several components to be in an `edit` state and you don't want them all to be calling on the same service instance.
