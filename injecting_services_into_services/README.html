<h3>Injecting a service into another service</h3>

<p>Inject a service into another service by importing it, and declaring a variable in the constructor with the type of the imported service.</p>

<blockquote><p><strong>Note:</strong> don&#39;t forget to make it injectable</p></blockquote>
<pre>
import { Injectable } from &#39;@angular/core&#39;;
import { AnotherService } from &#39;./services/another.service.ts&#39;;

@Injectable()
export class FirstService {
  constructor(service: AnotherService) {
    this.stuff = service.performAction();
  }
}
</pre>
